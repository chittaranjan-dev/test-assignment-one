<b> Assignment folders </b>
  
 1. Rupendra.Assignment (Visual studio solution includes Angular code in ClientApp).
 2. Rupendra.Assignment.UnitTest (Unit test for Balance check logic)
 3. Postman Collection  (Api Testing)


<b> Installation steps </b>

1. Open Solution file from project (Rupendra.Assignment) in Visual studio 2019
2. Firstly re-build the code 
    <ul>a) This will install node_module only the first time. If it is not exist (Script written in pre-build event command line)</ul>
    <ul>b) Angular build (ng build) will run every time when project is rebuild</ul>
    <ul>c) Visual studio will build.</ul>
3. than run the solution

<b> Project Structure </b>
1. There is only one solution for Angular and .Net core api.
2. Angular code is in <b>ClientApp</b> folder in project solution
3. When code is rebuild that time both Angular and Visual studio are build.

<b> Development tools </b>
1. Angular  : Visual source code
2. WebApi   : Visual studio 2019
3. Database : Sql Lite

<b>Note :</b>
I have experience of working on two different solutions of Angular and Visual studio.
In that case we need to implement CORS.
